### ChannelEngine FE Assignment

### Setting up environment

You can use `.env` file (as per the included `.env.sample`) when running the server.
The environment variables to be used in local development are as follows:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CE_REST_API`: URL of the API
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CE_API_KEY`: API key

Make sure that you have installed `Node V16` and set up the required env variables before running server locally.

### Running locally

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run start`

Server app will now be hosted locally on port **3000**,

### Integration/API testing

[Pending]
Run `npm run test` to run the test suite.
